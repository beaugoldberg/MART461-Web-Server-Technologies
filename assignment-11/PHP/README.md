# PHP code

I added special character encoding to handle html tags being inserted into the text boxes.
All of my queries are stored procedures so they are safe from SQL Injection from what we talked about.

I also took the time to make sure I was able to store my UserID once logged in and access it across other pages. I added the functionallity of being locked out but made it 
turned off by default to make working with the site easier as i dont have a password recover page yet. It does work though and I got the show user information to work by the
user that logs in.
